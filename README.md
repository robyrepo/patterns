design pattern 

										*Creational Patterns

Abstract Factory => Creates an instance of several families of classes
Factory Method   =>	Creates an instance of several derived classes
builder          => Separates object construction from its representation
singelton        => A class of which only a single instance can exist

										*Structural Patterns

adapter         =>  Match interfaces of different classes
bridge          =>	Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
decorator       =>  Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
Facade	        =>  A single class that represents an entire subsystem
Composite       =>


										*Behavioral Patterns
										
chain           => A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
startegy        => Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
observer        => A way of notifying change to a number of classes
state           => Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
visitor         => Defines a new operation to a class without change
